  <p>I really like Clojure. A lot. Since I’ve started using it seriously, I find myself going
to it to solve most of my problems. My previous go-to language was Python. It has its
share of issues (GIL, for example), but overall, it’s a joy to work in. Given its ease
of use, it’s quite a popular language as well. As such, it’s pretty easy to find developers
who know it, or are at least comfortable with it.</p>

<p>As much as I like Clojure, developer onboarding is a concern when starting a new project.
Some friends approached me to help them with an idea they had. They’re both non-technical,
so any decisions in this realm were left up to me. I would have loved to use Clojure, but
finding people to help develop their app would be a little harder. So I found myself
looking at Python again. Based off my previous experience, I found myself looking at two
web frameworks to build the backend: <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a> and
<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>.</p>

<p>I’m fairly familiar with Flask. I’ve used it to build big and small projects. I wasn’t
particularly familiar with Django, so along with doing some tutorials/reading the
documentation, I attended a few local Django meetups. The last one got cancelled, but
I was supposed to give a talk comparing the two frameworks from my point of view. Since
that meetup was cancelled, I’ve decided to write up a blog post instead. Note that this
is all based off of my somewhat limited experience.</p>

<h2 id="flask">Flask</h2>
<p>Flask is great. It’s a microframework written by <a href="https://twitter.com/@mitsuhiko">Armin Ronacher</a>. I personally love it. It’s incredibly flexible and easy to use. A basic app, as
seen on the Flask homepage is as simple as this:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">flask</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Flask</span>
<span class="n">app</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Flask</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">__name__</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="nd">@app.route</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"/"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hello</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s">"Hello World!"</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">"__main__"</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a pretty straightforward example. You import the library, generate an app object,
designate route handlers, etc. The API is very clean and easy to understand. For these
reasons, I think Flask excels for small projects, but also for large ones (more on this
shortly).</p>

<p>The double-edged sword of Flask is its unopinionated nature. For beginners, this presents
a relatively small surface area that they need to learn. Flask handles routing, has a
templating library, and not much else. When it comes to security, database integration,
and other aspects that larger apps require, it’s up to the developer to determine what to
use. Flask really doesn’t care. This is good if you know what you’re doing, but can be a
bit intimidating if you’re new to development. It’s easy to make bad decisions due to
inexperience.</p>

<h2 id="django">Django</h2>
<p>Django takes a very different approach. It’s similar to Ruby on Rails -
“batteries-included”. Pretty much everything is decided for you: the database ORM, routing,
templating, etc. While this is great for getting an app up quickly, it’s not very
flexible. Swapping components, or using Django in a way besides a monolithic app can
present some challenges. That said, it does a great job of presenting a working
development pattern.</p>

<p>The biggest downside is that, like Ruby on Rails, it requires the developers to learn a
rather large system. You have to learn how to do things the “Django way”. Which isn’t
necessarily a bad thing. It just means that you’ll generally have to focus on learning
the system first, then building your app. No shortcuts. To make a point, the Flask example
above tells you most of what you need to know. There is a short tutorial that goes through
templating and some other features. Django is <strong>much</strong> more complicated, requiring a
lengthy tutorial and likely some digging through documentation to understand all of what is
going on.</p>

<h2 id="issues-and-strengths">Issues and Strengths</h2>
<p>There are a few things surrounding the use of these frameworks worth mentioning. The
Python2/Python3 divide is mostly resolved (you should probably use Python3 unless you
have a specific reason not to). Django is very up-to-date with this. Since most of their
components are specific to the Django ecosystem, they are all up-to-date and use Python3,
assuming the version of Django you are using supports it.</p>

<p>In contrast, while Flask <em>does</em> support Python 3, it’s noted
<a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/python3/">on the website</a> that not all
extensions do.</p>

<p>Django also provides long-term support (LTS) releases. If you’re using Django for a large
application or simply in a large organization, these may be worth exploring for their
stability.</p>

<h2 id="which-should-i-use">Which should I use?</h2>
<p>Both Flask and Django are great frameworks. Given their strengths and weaknesses, I’d
recommend the following path for someone wishing to learn web development in Python.</p>

<p>First, learn Flask. It’s pretty small, and most people should be able to wrap their brain
around it fairly quickly. Follow the tutorial. Then, build a small app. It could be a list
making app, a Twitter bot, whatever.</p>

<p>Once you’ve done that, go and learn Django. Build something larger with it: maybe a CMS.</p>

<p>Finally, go back and learn how to build a similarly large application in Flask. This will
require you to pick a number of libraries, understand how they fit together, their
tradeoffs, etc.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that these aren’t the only web frameworks available for Python.
