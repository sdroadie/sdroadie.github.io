<p>I’ve been learning Clojure lately. It does a lot of things right as a languages.
But I don’t think we should stop there. The same principles that make a good
language could be applied to application design.</p>

<p>One thing that has bothered me since I got a smartphone is the number of to-do
apps. Building a to-do app is a great way to learn most web frameworks (and
probably mobile ones too?), but that doesn’t mean they need to all be published.
Worse still is the fact that very few of them do anything novel. Simple design
and ease of use is great, but we aren’t creating anymore of an experience that
pen and paper.</p>

<p>My idea is this: let the user control their data. In my personal day, I need to
keep track of numerous things, and each would benefit from a different
organizatonal structure. For tracking coursework, I want to be able to input
assignments based off of class, and I want to be able to bind due dates and
other related information. I also need to buy food. A grocery list is a very
different type of list. I need to track quantity for one. I also tend to need
to the same things (milk, bread, eggs, etc.) week to week. Being able to have
recurring items would be fantastic.</p>

<p>I know that all of these things are available in a number of different apps. But
that’s the crux of the problem: why do I need so many different apps to handle
day to day life? Give me one to-do app that puts me in control of my
information, and I’d gladly pay for it.</p>
